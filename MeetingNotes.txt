October 4 2023 meeting with Randy and Vicente
Vicente prepared letters to different museums to request tissue vouchers. He will now polish these up so they include all of the target species (multiple specices in a single letter to a each institution).
Next week we will discuss primers

September 29 2023 meeting with Randy and Vicente
1. Double check that Aspidoscelis velox originated from Aspidoscelis stictogramma mama (this may also be in literature as Cnemidophorus burti or Aspidoscelis burti)
2. From the white board phylogeny, what sequences are available
-- Mark which ones are in the sequence files (under the 'sequences' directory)
-- Mark which ones are available from genbank (many of these will already be in the 'sequences' directory)
-- On genbank, if it is the whole mitochondrial genome, just write that
-- Mark which ones are nuclear and which are mitochondrial
3. From the white board phylogeny, find out which species have tissues available from museums
-- Ideally, velox and tigris samples from southern Utah (but if unavailable, that's okay)


September 15 2023 meeting with Randy and Vicente
1. Search literature for a mitochondrial primer that will work with whiptail lizards
-- This will include the genera "Aspidoscelis" or "Cnemidophorus" (which was the name of the genus before ~2000s)
-- Look for primers for these genes: ND2, CO1, CYTB, 12S, or 16S. We really only need one of them, so its okay if you can't find primers for one of the genes
-- On google scholar, use search criteria such as ("mitochondrial") and "PCR" and "primers" and ("Aspidoscelis" or "Cnemidophorus")
2. Randy will purchase DNA xtraction kit and PCR kit
3. Also, look for tissues on VertNet for Cnemidophorus neomexicana, Cnemidophorus neomexicanus, Aspidoscelis neomexicana, or Aspidoscelis neomexicanus
-- Those are all the same species, but different ways people may have input the names
-- See if you can find tissues from the Salt Lake area that we could potentially use, in addition to tissues along the Rio Grande
-- If you look at a map, it would be nice to get tissues from Northern NM (around Albuquerque), central NM (around Socorro), and southern NM (around Las Cruces)
